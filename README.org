* Status

This is just a quick hack.  I tried to come up with more sophisticated
functions which would drive the STM machine into the various corners
available.  However, those functions I could come up with, which would
do this in a repeatable, reliable way, would all use (Thread/sleep x)
which lead to the benchmarks depending mainly on those sleep times.

* How to run

Note, that the projects calls Clojure 1.2.1 as its dependency.
Usually I will use a Clojure compiled from the sources and run it very
basic REPL with 

 java -cp path/to/my/compiled/clojure.jar clojure.main

Then I ususally paste the functions from this project and look how
they perform.  Only the development of the functions is done with
swank and slime.
